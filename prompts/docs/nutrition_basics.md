# Nutrition Basics for Endurance Athletes

- Goal: preserve muscle, fuel sessions, recover quickly.
- Carbs: 3–6 g/kg/day base; 60–90 g/h during >2h rides.
- Protein: 1.8–2.2 g/kg/day for hypertrophy and repair.
- Timing: 30–60 g carbs + 20–30 g protein in first 60 min post-session.
- Hydration: 500–750 ml/h in heat; add electrolytes.
- Fasted Z2: used selectively for metabolic adaptation. Avoid when volume/intensity high.
